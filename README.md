I have here my Solutions from my CSSBattle which I enjoy a lot.
I try tackle it on two ways

1. It is my clean code Solution, which I could use in regular work at the real websites and Applications. Clean and ready to use
2. It is for Min-maxing my CSSBattle score, which apply every CSS-trick I ever know and I simply use here every technique for the same result with as less character count as possible
